# Sorting Alg Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing sorting algorithms, aimed at making it easier to understand how various sorting techniques operate. This project showcases **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and the chaotic **Bogo Sort**, offering an engaging way to see these algorithms in action.

## Key Learning Points

- **Asynchronous Programming**: This project deepened my understanding of **async/await** and **promises** through the creation of the visualizations. I implemented features to **abort ongoing algorithms** and adjust the **speed** dynamically.
- **React Hooks**: I refined my skills with essential React hooks like **useState**, **useEffect**, and **useContext** to manage state, handle side effects, and share data across components effectively.

- **Front-End Design**: Working on the project allowed me to practice basic front-end design, particularly with creating a **retractable sidebar** for easy navigation.

- **Controlled Components**: I utilized controlled components to ensure smooth interaction with the UI elements, allowing real-time changes without glitches.

- **Type Safety**: I took extra care to ensure that all components and logic were correctly typed, enhancing the maintainability and robustness of the project.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms
- Speed control and algorithm abortion functionality
- Responsive and retractable sidebar for easy navigation
- Fully typed components for better code quality and reliability

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** as the build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, including Tailwind CSS for utility-first design
